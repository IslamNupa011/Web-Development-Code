##3HTML supports 140 standard color names.

###Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.
rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red
 black, all color parameters must be set to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).
 white, all color parameters must be set to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).

###In HTML, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value
  rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
  #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to the lowest value (00)

### a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL-hue,saturation,lightness) .
Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
Lightness is also a percentage, 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white

###Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color.
100% is pure color, no shades of gray
50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.
0% is completely gray, you can no longer see the color.
 0% lightness means black, and 100 lightness means white.

##rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)
RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

##hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)
The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):
