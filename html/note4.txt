##CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.
An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.
An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element:
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, by changing one file.
To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of the HTML page:
An external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code,
 and must be saved with a .css extension.
The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border
The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border:
the id of an element should be unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
To define a style for a special type of elements, add a class attribute to the element
