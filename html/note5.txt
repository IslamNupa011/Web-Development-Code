##Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.

HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document.

When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

Note: A link does not have to be text. It can be an image or any other HTML element.

The href attribute specifies the destination address (https://www.w3schools.com/html/) of the link.

The link text is the visible part (Visit our HTML tutorial).

Clicking on the link text will send you to the specified address.

Note: Without a forward slash on subfolder addresses, you might generate two requests to the server. 
Many servers will automatically add a forward slash to the address, and then create a new request.


##_blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
_self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)
_parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window
framename - Opens the linked document in a named frame


##HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a Web page.
Bookmarks can be useful if your webpage is very long.
To make a bookmark, you must first create the bookmark, and then add a link to it.
When the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.

Use the <a> element to define a link
Use the href attribute to define the link address
Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link

Use the id attribute (id="value") to define bookmarks in a page
Use the href attribute (href="#value") to link to the bookmark
<a>	Defines a hyperlink

##If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the value of the alt attribute:

Use the HTML <img> element to define an image
Use the HTML src attribute to define the URL of the image
Use the HTML alt attribute to define an alternate text for an image, if it cannot be displayed
Use the HTML width and height attributes to define the size of the image
Use the CSS width and height properties to define the size of the image (alternatively)
Use the CSS float property to let the image float
Use the HTML <map> element to define an image-map
Use the HTML <area> element to define the clickable areas in the image-map
Use the HTML <img>'s element usemap attribute to point to an image-map
Use the HTML <picture> element to show different images for different devices
Note: Loading images takes time. Large images can slow down your page. Use images carefully.
