###Using The class Attribute
The class attribute specifies one or more class names for an HTML element.

The class name can be used by CSS and JavaScript to perform certain tasks for elements with the specified class name.

###Using The class Attribute in JavaScript
JavaScript can access elements with a specified class name by using the getElementsByClassName() method:
Example--
When a user clicks on a button, hide all elements with the class name "city":


###HTML elements can have more than one class name, each class name must be separated by a space.

Example-
Style elements with the class name "city", also style elements with the class name "main":

<h2 class="city main">London</h2>
In the example above, the first h2 element belongs to both the "city" class and the "main" class.

###An iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.
An HTML iframe is defined with the <iframe> tag:

<iframe src="URL"></iframe>
The src attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the inline frame page.
Use the height and width attributes to specify the size of the iframe.

The attribute values are specified in pixels by default, but they can also be in percent (like "80%").
<iframe>	Defines an inline frame


###JavaScript makes HTML pages more dynamic and interactive.

###Path	Description
<img src="picture.jpg">	picture.jpg is located in the same folder as the current page
<img src="images/picture.jpg">	picture.jpg is located in the images folder in the current folder
<img src="/images/picture.jpg">	picture.jpg is located in the images folder at the root of the current web
<img src="../picture.jpg">	picture.jpg is located in the folder one level up from the current folder

File paths are used when linking to external files like:

Web pages
Images
Style sheets
JavaScripts

###The HTML <head> Element
The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.

HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.

Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, links, scripts, and other meta information.

The following tags describe metadata: <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, and <base>.

###The <meta> element is used to specify which character set is used, page description, keywords, author, 
and other metadata.

Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content), by search engines (keywords), and other web services.

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML,CSS,XML,JavaScript">
  <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
</head>

Refresh document every 30 seconds:

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">

###Setting The Viewport
HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tag.

The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone 
than on a computer screen.

You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
A <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary 
depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag:

Tip: If you are browsing this page with a phone or a tablet, you can click on the two links below to see the difference.

####According to the HTML5 standard; the <html>, the <body>, and the <head> tag can be omitted.

The following code will validate as HTML5:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<title>Page Title</title>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

Note:

W3Schools does not recommend omitting the <html> and <body> tags. Omitting these tags can crash DOM or 
XML software and produce errors in older browsers (IE9).

However, omitting the <head> tag has been a common practice for quite some time now.
