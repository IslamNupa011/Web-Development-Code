PHP statements end with a semicolon (;).

// This is a single-line comment

# This is also a single-line comment

/*
This is a multiple-lines comment block
that spans over multiple
lines
*/
// You can also use comments to leave out parts of a code line
$x = 5 /* + 15 */ + 5;

###In PHP, all keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are 
NOT case-sensitive.

In the example below, all three echo statements below are legal (and equal):

###Variables are "containers" for storing information.

Note: When you assign a text value to a variable, put quotes around the value.

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for PHP variables:

A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)
Remember that PHP variable names are case-sensitive!

PHP automatically converts the variable to the correct data type, depending on its value.

In other languages such as C, C++, and Java, the programmer must declare the name and type of the variable before using it.

PHP has three different variable scopes:

local
global
static
